Connecting your device to your PC
================================
To connect your device to a PC, first make sure you have Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC) installed ,or ActiveSync if you are using Windows XP. If you have used WMDC before, it may automaticly start when you connect your device to your PC using USB, otherwise, start WMDC from the start menu.

If you do not have WMDC installed see download links below. The installers say that they are for Windows Vista but are the latest and do work with Windows 7; although Windows 10 may require additionional configuration to work.
