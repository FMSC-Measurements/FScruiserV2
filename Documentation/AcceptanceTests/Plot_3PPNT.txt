Feature: 3PPNT tally
    3PPNT is a plot based cruising method where a KPI is estimated for the plot, 
    and based on that the plot is determined to either be in or out. 
    When a plot is in, a tree record is created for all the trees in the plot. 

Given the folowing strata exist:
    |code   |method |baf    |KZ |
    |01     |3PPNT  |35     |100|
    
WHEN the user adds a plot 
THEN the 3PPNT plot screen show
AND the displayed KZ is 100
AND only values between 0 and 999 are allowed in Tree Count
AND only values between 0 and 999 are allowed in Average Height

SCENARIO: View displayed with correct controls enabled
    GIVEN the user is adding a 3PPNT plot
    AND the 3PPNT screen is displayed
    THEN the volumn factor textbox is disabled
    AND the tree count textbox is enabled
    AND the Average height textbox is enabled
    AND the KPI displayed is blank

SCENARIO: KPI updates when tree count and avg Ht are entered
    GIVEN the user is adding a 3PPNT plot
    AND the 3PPNT screen is displayed
    AND volume factor show .333
    WHEN the user enters 10 for the tree count
    AND 30 for the average height
    THEN KPI shows 3496 = 10 * 30 * baf(35) * .333 
    
SCENARIO: Trees are generated for measure plot
    GIVEN the user enters a tree count of 10 
    WHEN the user gets a measure plot
    THEN the message "measure plot" is displayed
    AND a plot containing 10 tree is added

SCENARIO: Trees are not generated for count plot
    GIVEN the user enters a tree count of 10 
    AND the plot number is n
    WHEN the user gets a count plot
    THEN the message "count plot" is displayed 
    AND a plot containing 0 tree is added
    AND the 3PPNT screen is redisplayed with plot number n + 1

SCENARIO: Empty plot
    GIVEN the user is adding a 3PPNT plot
    AND Tree Count is 0
    AND Average Height is 0
    WHEN the user clicks ok
    THEN a plot is added with IsNull == true
    
SCENARIO: User entered values stored 
    GIVEN a plot is added
    AND Tree Count is 10 
    AND Average Height is 30
    AND KPI is 3496
    THEN Remarks contans "|Tree Cnt = 10, Avg Ht = 30, KPI = 3496|"
    
    
SCENARIO: Display plot info for 3PPNT plot
    GIVEN a plot is selected
    WHEN the user clicks the plot info button 
    THEN the the standard plot info is displayed
