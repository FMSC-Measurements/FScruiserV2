Feature: tree validation
    allow the user to set up validation rule for data entered on trees. 
    Validation rules will changed based on what the species of the tree is.
    Only fields visable to the user will be validated. 
    In addition to user defined validation rules, 
    built in validation will be performed, such as insuring that a tree has a species.

WHEN unit 01 loads

AND tree 02 has an error on species     //pass on PC, on FDR error shows in error message but not on field

Scenario: tree audit error is removed when the value is fixed

Scenario: error are updated, when c/m is changed to M

Scenario: error are updated, when c/m is changed to C
    GIVEN unit 02 is loaded
    WHEN the c/m on tree 05 is changed to C
    THEN tree 05 doesn't have any errors    //pass

Scenario: when leaving unit, aleart user of tree errors
    GIVEN at least one tree has an error
    WHEN the user closes the data entry screen 
    THEN the user is told that there are errors and asked if they would like to continue //pass
