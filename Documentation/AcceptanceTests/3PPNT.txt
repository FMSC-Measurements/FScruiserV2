Feature: 3PPNT tally
    3PPNT is a plot based cruising method where a KPI is estimated for the plot, 
    and based on that the plot is determined to either be in or out. 
    When a plot is in, a tree record is created for all the trees in the plot.

AND volume factor show .333
WHEN the user enters 10 for the tree count
AND 30 for the average height
THEN tree count shows 10 
AND average height shows 30
AND KPI shows 3496 = 10 * 30 * baf(35) * .333
