Feature: Tree Default defined values
	some values on trees are set my the species selected, when the species is changed then the value change along with it.
	user also have the option of setting a value different from what the species has defined. If they enter a different 	value then that value is stored on the tree record and the tree record keeps that value even if the species is changed
	Tree properties that support this behavior are: Hidden Primary 

Background:
GIVEN a cruise file exists with one unit
AND one stratum
AND the following sample group exists:
    |Code   |Species    |
    |01     |A & B      |

AND the following TreeDefaults exist:
    |Species    |HiddenPrimary  |
    |A          |10             |
    |B          |11             |
    |C          |0              |
AND the following trees exist:
    |Tree # |SG |Species    |HiddenPrimary  |
    |1      |01 |A          |0              |  
    |2      |01 |A          |15             |
    |3      |01 |B          |0               |
    |4      |01 |           |0               |
    
WHEN tree 1 is displayed 
THEN the ueser sees a HiddenPrimary value of 10

WHEN tree 2 is displayed 
THEN the ueser sees a HiddenPrimary value of 15

WHEN tree 3 is displayed 
THEN the ueser sees a HiddenPrimary value of 11

WHEN tree 4 is displayed 
THEN the ueser sees a HiddenPrimary value of 0

WHEN when the species of tree 4 is changed to A 
THEN the ueser sees a HiddenPrimary value of 10
