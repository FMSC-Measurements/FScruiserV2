WHEN the user enters the data entry screen
THEN the data entry screen contains the folling tabs: Trees, Tally, 02F3P[2], 03-P3P[3]
    
WHEN the user tallys a tree
THEN the three p number pad is displayed

GIVEN the user has tallyed a tree
AND the three p number pad is displayed
WHEN the user doesn't enter a number 
AND clicks accept
THEN the message "No Value Entered" is displayed
AND the three p number pad is closed                //should we have a cancel button instead?
AND the device squaks                               //fail
AND nothing is added to the tally history

GIVEN the user has tallyed 204
AND the three p number pad is displayed
WHEN the user enters 9 
AND clicks accept
THEN the message "Must be Greater or Equal to 10" is displayed
AND the device squaks                               //fail

GIVEN the user has tallyed 204
AND the three p number pad is displayed
WHEN the user enters 31 
AND clicks accept
THEN the message "Must be Less or Equal to 30" is displayed
AND the device squaks                               //fail


GIVEN the user has tallyed a tree
AND the three p number pad is displayed
WHEN the user clicks STM 
AND clicks accept
THEN a entry is added to the tally history ending with M
AND a tree record has been added  with a KPI = 0, STM = Y


GIVEN has enter a KPI of <x>
WHEN the user doent get a insurance tree or a measure tree
THEN a entry is added to the tally history ending with "[<x>]"
AND the sum KPI value in the Tally infomation has been increased by <x>

GIVEN the user has enabled the cruiser selection popup
AND has enter a KPI of <x>
WHEN the user gets a measure tree
THEN the device beeps
AND the message "Measure Tree" is displayed
FOLLOWED BY the cruiser selection screen
FOLLOWED BY the message "Would you like to enter tree data now?"
AND the sup KPI value in the Tally infomation has been increased by <x>
AND a entry is added to the tally history ending with "[<x>]"
AND a tree record has been added  with a KPI = <x>, STM = N

GIVEN the user has added a tree using the Add Tree button 
AND given it the sample group value of 01 
AND given it the species value of 204
AND entering the KPI value of 50 will generate a sample
WHEN the user changes the KPI value from 0 to 50 
THEN the message "Measure Tree" is displayed            //fail
AND the Count or Measure value on the tree is M         //fail
AND the sum kpi of of the 204 tally is increased by 50  //fail

GIVEN a tree exist with a tree_cn of 1 and kpi of 100
WHEN the kpi of tree_cn 1 is changed to 80 
THEN a record is added to the messageLog table with the message "Tree RecID:1 KPI changed from 100 to 80"
AND the sum kpi has been reduced by 20                  //fail
