Feature: three p tally
    users can tally trees using the three p method. Three p only supports tally by species and three p sample selection

WHEN the user enters the data entry screen
THEN the data entry screen contains the folling tabs: Trees, Tally, 02F3P[2], 03-P3P[3]
    
WHEN the user tallys a tree
THEN the three p number pad is displayed

Senario: user doen't enter a kpi value
    GIVEN the user has tallyed a tree
    AND the three p number pad is displayed
    WHEN the user doesn't enter a number 
    AND clicks accept
    THEN the message "No Value Entered" is displayed
    AND the three p number pad is not closed                
    AND the device squaks                               //fail
    AND nothing is added to the tally history

Senario: user enters a kpi that is less than the min kpi
    GIVEN the user has tallyed 204
    AND the three p number pad is displayed
    WHEN the user enters 9 
    AND clicks accept
    THEN the message "Must be Greater or Equal to 10" is displayed
    AND the device squaks                               //fail

Senario: user enters a kpi that is greater than the max kpi
    GIVEN the user has tallyed 204
    AND the three p number pad is displayed
    WHEN the user enters 31 
    AND clicks accept
    THEN the message "Must be Less or Equal to 30" is displayed
    AND the device squaks                               //fail

Senario: user tallys a STM tree
    GIVEN the user has tallyed a tree
    AND the three p number pad is displayed
    WHEN the user clicks STM 
    AND clicks accept
    THEN a entry is added to the tally history ending with M
    AND a tree record has been added  with a KPI = 0, STM = Y

Senario Outline: user tallys a non measure tree tree
    GIVEN has enter a KPI of <x>
    WHEN the user doent get a insurance tree or a measure tree
    THEN a entry is added to the tally history ending with "[<x>]"
    AND the sum KPI value in the Tally infomation has been increased by <x>
    
    Examples:
        |x  |
        |30 |
        |10 |

Senario Outline: user tallys a measure tree tree with cruiser selection enabled
    GIVEN the user has enabled the cruiser selection popup
    AND has enter a KPI of <x>
    WHEN the user gets a measure tree
    THEN the device beeps
    AND the message "Measure Tree" is displayed
    FOLLOWED BY the cruiser selection screen
    FOLLOWED BY the message "Would you like to enter tree data now?"
    AND the sup KPI value in the Tally infomation has been increased by <x>
    AND a entry is added to the tally history ending with "[<x>]"
    AND a tree record has been added  with a KPI = <x>, STM = N
    
    Examples:
        |x  |
        |30 |
        |10 |

Senario: check for sample when the user set the kpi on a tree //no longer supported 
    GIVEN the user has added a tree using the Add Tree button 
    AND given it the sample group value of 01 
    AND given it the species value of 204
    AND entering the KPI value of 50 will generate a sample
    WHEN the user changes the KPI value from 0 to 50 
    THEN the message "Measure Tree" is displayed            //fail
    AND the Count or Measure value on the tree is M         //fail
    AND the sum kpi of of the 204 tally is increased by 50  //fail

Senario: user changes the kpi of a tree 		    //no longer supported 
    GIVEN a tree exist with a tree_cn of 1 and kpi of 100
    WHEN the kpi of tree_cn 1 is changed to 80 
    THEN a record is added to the messageLog table with the message "Tree RecID:1 KPI changed from 100 to 80"
    AND the sum kpi has been reduced by 20                  //fail
