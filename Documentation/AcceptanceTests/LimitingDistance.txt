Feature: limiting distance calculator
    users can use the limiting distance calculator to help determin if trees are out or in, 
    when doing plot cruiseing 
    
Background:

GIVEN the following strata exist:
    |code   |method |plot size/baf  |
    |01     |FIX    |10             |
    |02     |PCM    |30             |
    |03     |PNT    |35             |
    |04     |STR    |               |
    
WHEN the user enters the data entry screen
THEN the data entry screen contains the folling tabs: Trees, Tally, 01-FIX[], 02-PCM[], 03-PNT[]



GIVEN the user is not on a plot tab
WHEN the user clicks on Menu
THEN Limiting Distance is disabled

Senario: plot strata is selected but no plot is selected
    GIVEN the user is in a plot tab
    AND no plot is selected
    WHEN the user opens the limiting distance screen
    THEN the message "No Plot Selected" is displayed

Senario: FIX strata is selected
GIVEN the user is on the 01-FIX tab
AND a plot is selected
WHEN the user opens the limiting distance screen
THEN the limiting distance screen has a text box with the label FPS
AND the FPS text box shows the value 10

Selected: variable radious plot is selected
GIVEN the user is on the 02-PCM tab
AND a plot is selected
WHEN the user opens the limiting distance screen
THEN the limiting distance screen has a text box with the label BAF
AND the BAF text box shows the value 30

Senario: limiting distance out puts report when closed
GIVEN the user is in a plot tab
AND a plot is selected
AND the limiting distance screen is open 
AND the limiting distance has been calculated
WHEN the user clicks OK 
THEN the Remarks value for the current plot contains a entry showing the result of the limiting distance calculation


// i think this feature was removed intentionaly 
// see FormLimitingDistance.cs: 318
GIVEN the user is in a plot tab
AND the DBH field of a tree is selected
AND the DBH value of the current tree is <x>
AND the limiting distance screen is open
AND the calculated limiting distance shows that the tree is in
WHEN the use clicks OK
THEN the DBH of the current tree is changed to <x> //fails
