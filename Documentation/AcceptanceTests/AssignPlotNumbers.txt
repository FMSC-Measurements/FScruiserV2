Feature: assign plot numbers
    when there are multiple plot strata in a unit
    and one stratum is ahead of the others in numbering plots
    new plots in strata that are behind will be given the current highest plot number in the unit
    and new plots in the strata that is ahead will be given the highest plot number in the unit + 1

Background:
GIVEN the following units exist:
    |code   |
    |01     |
    |02     |
AND the following strata exist
    |code   |unit   |method |
    |01     |01 & 02|PCM    |
    |02     |01 & 02|PCM    |
AND the following plots exist
    |unit   |stratum|Plot#  |
    |01     |01     |1      |
    |01     |01     |2      |
    
Senario: when one stratum is behind in plot number, keep in step with highest plot number
    GIVEN unit 01 is the current unit
    AND stratum 02 is the current stratum
    WHEN the user adds a new plots
    THEN the new plot is given plot number 2 // pass

Senario: when stratum has the highest plot number in unit, assign next plot number
    GIVEN unit 01 is the current unit
    AND stratum 01 is the current stratum
    WHEN the user adds a new plots
    THEN the new plot is given plot number 3 // pass
