Feature: tally history 
    The user can see a history of tallies in a given unit.     
    From the tally history they can untally previouse tallies.
    note: only tree based tallies are stored in the tally history 
    and tally history only goes back a fix number of tallies
    
GIVEN the following units exist:
    |code   |
    |01     |
    |02     |
AND the following strata exist:
    |code   |units  |method |    
    |01     |01&02  |STR    |
AND the following sample groups:
    |straum |code   |freq   |tally mode |
    |01     |01     |2      |by SG      |
AND the following tallies are setup:
    |SG     |TDV    |Description    |Counts (unit:treeCount)    |   
    |01     |       |01             |01:??                      |                
AND the following tree exist:
    |unit   |SG |Tree#  |Sp     |
    |01     |01 |1      |A      |        
    |01     |01 |2      |A      |
    |       |   |       |       |
AND unit 01 has the following tally history records
    |info       |
    |01         |
    |01 #1 M    |
    |01 #2 M    |
    
WHEN the user is in in unit 01
THEN tally history shows (01,01 #1 M)
AND tally record "01 - 01 M" is selected  
AND the tree view has one tree record with Tree# = 1

WHEN the user is in unit 02
THEN tally history shows no records

GIVEN the user is in unit 01
AND tally record "01 #1 M" is selected 
WHEN untally is clicked
THEN the message "Are you sure?\r\nThis will delete the following tree record: 1" //respond no because this tally record may be used by other test

GIVEN the user untallied a tally with a tree record
WHEN the user responds "yes" to untally warning message
THEN the tree count is decremented
AND the associated tree record is deleted

WHEN tree 02 is deleted 
THEN tally record "01 #2 M" is removed      //fails
