# Installing FScruiser V2

## PC

For Forest Service users we recommend installing FScruiser V2 using the [Software Center](#software-center-installation)

For all other users, the latest version of FScruiser V2 can be downloaded from the following locations
 - [FMSC Website](https://www.fs.fed.us/forestmanagement/products/measurement/cruising/fscruiser/index.php)
 - [Github](https://github.com/FMSC-Measurements/FScruiserV2/releases/latest)

## Software Center Installation
If installing FScruiser V2 for the first time from the Software Center you may need to uninstall previous versions first. [Follow These Instructions](Install_Remove_Old_Versions.md) for uninstalling older versions. 

### Portable Install (Zip)
This option can be used to install FScruiser to a thumb drive, try out an older/newer version without doing a full installation, or install on a computer without administrative privileges. 

If you get a "Windows protected your PC" message from when you try running the extracted exe, right click on the exe, go to Properties and check `Unblock` 

Extracting using 7-zip can also prevent a "Windows protected your PC" message.
 

## Mobile

To download the mobile version of FScruiser V2 please go to [our website](https://www.fs.fed.us/forestmanagement/products/measurement/cruising/fscruiser/index.php) and download the CAB installer.
