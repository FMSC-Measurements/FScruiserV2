# PC

## Portable Install (Zip)
This option can be used to install FScruiser to a thumb drive or for computer where the user is not allowed to run the regular installer.

!insert section on how to obtain the proper file!

Expand Zip file to a folder where you want to keep it, on your computer or on a thumb drive. For this I recommend using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) if you have it. Doing so will save you from being shown a warning message being shown every time you run FScruiser, alerting you that the file you are running is from the internet.

## Install Using PC

Before you start:

If this is the first time installing an application to your device from the PC you are using you may need to start Microsoft Windows Mobile Device Center before your PC will recognize your device. Before starting the installation insure that Windows Mobile Device Center or ActiveSync is running and connected to your device.

- Start the installer. Note that on Forest Service computers the install may not run properly if you use the “Run Elevated” command. 

- Proceed through the installation steps until the “Add/Remove Programs” window pop’s up. Here you may be prompted with several questions. If it tells you that “Microsoft .NET CF ## is already installed, you may click No. If it tells you that FScruiserV2 is already installed and if you would like to reinstall/upgrade, click yes.

- Once you complete all the steps above and have exited the installation, your device may show that it is processing the installation, and then the installation will be complete.


## Without Using a PC - Field Install/Upgrade

Before you start:

Using the field installation method may not work in all situation. Additional software may be required. It is recommended to only use field installation when installation using a PC is not an option or when upgrading an existing FScruiser V2 installation.

- Make sure you have downloaded the correct CAB file for your device

- Using Window Mobile Device Center, ActiveSync or a removable storage card, copy the CAB file onto your device.

- On the device, click on the CAB file to run the installer.

- Select install on device.

- Once the installation is complete run FScruiser V2 to insure it was installed correctly.
